Based on your description, here are some rules that could be applied:\n\n1. **Identify `<button>` Elements**: When parsing the HTML, you should recognize `<button>` elements as potential interactive components that may trigger actions but are not themselves input elements for data collection.\n\n2. **Nested `<li>` Elements**: If there are `<li>` (list item) elements nested within a `<button>` element, these should be considered as part of a menu or selection list associated with the button. They represent selectable values or options that a user can choose when interacting with the button, but they are not input elements where data is entered by the user.\n\n3. **Input Elements**: Input elements are typically identified by the `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and sometimes `<button>` tags when they are used to submit form data. However, in the context you've described, the `<button>` is not being used as a form submission element, and the nested `<li>` elements are not to be treated as input elements.\n\n4. **Selectable Values**: The `<li>` elements nested under the `<button>` should be treated as part of a selection mechanism. They might be used to present a dropdown menu or a list of options that can be selected when the button is clicked.\n\n5. **Interaction Handling**: When the `<button>` is activated (e.g., clicked by the user), the application should handle the interaction appropriately, possibly by displaying the nested `<li>` elements for the user to select from.\n\n6. **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensure that the interaction between the `<button>` and the nested `<li>` elements is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation. This might involve proper use of ARIA attributes and roles to convey the relationship and functionality to assistive technologies.\n\n7. **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML to ensure that the structure of the document is clear and meaningful. For example, if the `<li>` elements are part of a navigation menu, they should be enclosed within a `<nav>` element.\n\n8. **CSS and JavaScript**: Use CSS for styling and JavaScript for behavior. The appearance of the `<button>` and its nested `<li>` elements, as well as the interaction logic (e.g., showing and hiding the list of options), should be controlled through these technologies.\n\nRemember that these rules are based on the specific context you've provided. In different scenarios, the interpretation and handling of `<button>` and `<li>` elements might change, especially if they are part of a form or have different roles in the document structure.", "id": 1, "group": "Others"}
