  You will need to analyze a response from an AI assistant to a user's query. The response are as follows:
  
  [Response Start]
  {response}
  [Response End]
  
  And you are also given a set of characteristics with their name and description:
  
  [Characteristics Start]
  {characteristics}
  [Characteristics End]
  
  Your task is to assign a rating to each characteristic to show how the response matches the characteristic, based on the provided descriptions. The rating criteria are as follows:
  
    - 0: The response does not match the characteristic at all.
    - 1: The response matches the characteristic to some extent.
    - 2: The response matches the characteristic quite well.
    - 3: The response matches the characteristic perfectly.
  
  Please follow the characteristics and the rating criteria strictly. Your findings should be formatted in JSON, specifying the characteristic in question, and the rating:
  
  {
    "characteristic name 1": "0/1/2/3",
    ...
    "characteristic name n": "0/1/2/3"
  }
