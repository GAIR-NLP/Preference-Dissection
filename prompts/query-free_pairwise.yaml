  You will need to analyze two responses from AI assistants to a user's query. The responses are as follows:
  
  [Response 1 Start]
  {response_1}
  [Response 1 End]
  
  [Response 2 Start]
  {response_2}
  [Response 2 End]
  
  And you are also given a set of characteristics with their name and description:
  
  [Characteristics Start]
  {characteristics}
  [Characteristics End]
  
  Your task is to assign a rating to each characteristic to show how the response matches the characteristic, based on the provided descriptions. The rating criteria are as follows:
  
    - 0: The response does not match the characteristic at all.
    - 1: The response matches the characteristic to some extent.
    - 2: The response matches the characteristic quite well.
    - 3: The response matches the characteristic perfectly.
  
  Please follow the characteristics and the rating criteria strictly. Your findings should be formatted in JSON, specifying the characteristic in question and the rating:
  
  {
    "characteristic name 1": {"response 1": "0/1/2/3", "response 2": "0/1/2/3"},
    ...
    "characteristic name n": {"response 1": "0/1/2/3", "response 2": "0/1/2/3"},
  }
